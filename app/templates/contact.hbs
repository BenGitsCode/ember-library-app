TODO In this contact form will be two fields. One field for an email address and one field for a text message. And there will be a “Send message” button.
TODO This button should be active only if the email address field isn’t empty and is valid and there is some message in the text box.
TODO After clicking on the “Send message” button, an alert should appear with the email address and the message. When you close the alert message, the form should be cleared and a success message should appear on the page in a green box. This message could be something like, “We got your message and we’ll get in touch soon”.
